Ugh, just finished Dual and I don’t even know man, my brain’s like a scrambled egg. You know that feeling when a   just throws you for a loop? Yup, that was it. So, Sarah, right? Like, her life is literally the most surreal mess ever. Imagine finding out your clone’s doing better at your life than you are... yikes on all levels.

> The whole dual thing, I mean, honestly, who signs up for that? I’d be freaked out. And then these fight training montages? They felt like a warped Rocky or something. My brain's still trying to marinate on how bizarre but strangely fitting it all seemed.

And okay, some of the dialogue was just... weird. Had me chuckling randomly, probably when I wasn’t supposed to be. But that soundtrack though, loved it – had this eerie vibe that totally worked. Also, can we talk about how Karen Gillan is just boss? She pulls off these roles like it’s nobody’s business. But yeah, seriously, what’s up with that ending? I mean, totally WTF moment. I was not ready for that.

Someone said if you 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , the pacing feels different somehow. Don’t know what that’s about, LOL. Makes me want to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again, just to see if it feels the same or if it's just like, mind tricks. Seriously though, that whole mother thing? Awkward city, population: them. 

Ok, random thought blast! 😄 If my clone ever tried to take over my life, I think I'd end up just doing dumb twin pranks or something instead of, you know, fighting to the death. 😜 Anyway, 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it if you haven’t; prepare for the mental whiplash though.

Console.WriteLine(Why am I even typing this line of code?); // a minor brain glitch, maybe

Overall, bonkers but kind of cool? It left me with that kind of head-scratchy feeling, not exactly enlightenment but like, “Hmm, that just happened.” Plus, now I’m really curious about the original, like, screenplay or whatever goes on behind the scenes, you know? Anyway, let me know what you think if you give it a whirl. Could really use another brain to untangle this noodle. 😂
